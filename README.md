# iOS-Portfolio: Rachel Park
Rachel Park 2020-2021 Portfolio

Hello, I am Rachel Park, a junior at Eden Prairie High School who wants to be a visonary engineer with the potential to change even small parts of people's lives. I have always been interested in technology and machines ever since I can remember. I consider myself as a decent problem solver. That is why I wanted to learn how to code and have loved the learning process. Every programmer, I assume, knows the feeling when you resolve a difficult complication in your code, app, or website. That can be done in a complex manner or in a simpler, more efficient manner. I am usually in the former group; however, I have never deemed it as a weakness. To me, it is my strength because it means that I approach problems in a way that no one else does and I am creative in my own way.
