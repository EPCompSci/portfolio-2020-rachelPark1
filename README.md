# iOS-Portfolio: Rachel Park
Rachel Park 2020-2021 Portfolio

Hello, I am Rachel Park, a junior at Eden Prairie High School who wants to be a visonary engineer with the potential to change even small parts of people's lives. I have always been interested in technology and machines ever since I can remember. I consider myself as a decent problem solver. That is why I wanted to learn how to code and have loved the learning process. Every programmer, I assume, knows the feeling when you resolve a difficult complication in your code, app, or website. That can be done in a complex manner or in a simpler, more efficient manner. I am usually in the former group; however, I have never deemed it as a weakness. To me, it is my strength because it means that I approach problems in a way that no one else does and I am creative in my own way.

# ASL Alphabets

At the very beginning of this term, I wanted to make an app that was unique, helpful to minorities, and could possibly resolve even a small problem they were facing. I was having trouble with memorizing American Sign Language alphabets, so I decided to build an app that works as effective ASL alphabet flashcards that implement space repetition, which is proved to be a powerful studying technique.

I learned how to link a website with a button, Swift fundamental syntax, and other basic operating systems including app icons, images, storyboards, and various sources Xcode offers. I had an idea that provides users with more diverse studying options, such as simple flashcards, tests, and matching games. To do that, I realized that it would require multiple interchangeable views for smooth user experience. When we started our group project, that particular skill about multiple view controllers came in extremely useful.

# EPHS App

I wanted to make a practical app that would improve EPHS students' everyday lives, rather than a game. Then, I recalled my memory of my first day of high school; on that day, I was overwhelmed by a maze of school hallways.
