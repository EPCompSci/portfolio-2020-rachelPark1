# iOS-Portfolio: Rachel Park
Rachel Park 2020-2021 Portfolio

Hello, I am Rachel Park, a junior at Eden Prairie High School, who wants to be a visionary engineer with the potential to change even small parts of people's lives. I have always been interested in technology and machines ever since I can remember. I consider myself a decent problem solver. That is why I wanted to learn how to code and have loved the learning process. Every programmer, I assume, knows the feeling when you resolve a problematic complication in your code, app, or website. That can be done in a complex manner or in a simpler, more efficient manner. I am usually in the former group; however, I have never deemed it as a weakness. It is my strength because it means that I approach problems in a way that no one else does and I am creative in my own way.

# [ASL Alphabets](https://github.com/rachelPark1/asl-alphabets.git)

At the very beginning of this term, I wanted to make an app that was unique and helpful to minorities and could resolve even a small problem they were facing. I was having trouble with memorizing the American Sign Language alphabets, so I decided to build an app that works as effective ASL alphabet flashcards that implement spaced repetition, which is a powerful studying technique.

I learned how to link a website with a button, Swift fundamental syntax, and other basic operating systems including app icons, images, storyboards, and various sources Xcode offers. I had an idea that provides users with more diverse studying options, such as simple flashcards, tests, and matching games. To do that, I realized that it would require multiple interchangeable views for a smooth user experience. When we started our group project, that particular skill about multiple view controllers came in extremely useful.

# [EPHS App](https://github.com/connorholm/EPHS-App.git)

I wanted to make a useful app that would improve EPHS students' everyday lives, rather than a game. Then, I recalled my first day of high school being overwhelmed by a maze of school hallways. I remembered having to click so many links in order to communicate with teachers and counselors. So, as a group, we decided to create an app that is the ultimate guide of EPHS, involving a virtual school map, daily schedules, club announcements, teacher/counselor contact, and other diverse features. We have built a login view for security reasons so that only EPHS students are permitted to access the school map. We have multiple views that switch when a user clicks a button.
