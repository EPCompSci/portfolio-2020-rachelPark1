# iOS-Portfolio: Rachel Park
Rachel Park 2020-2021 Portfolio

Hello, I am Rachel Park, a junior at Eden Prairie High School, who wants to be a visionary engineer with the potential to change even small parts of people's lives. I have always been interested in technology and machines ever since I can remember. I consider myself a decent problem solver. That is why I wanted to learn how to code and have loved the learning process. Every programmer, I assume, knows the feeling when you resolve a problematic issue in your code, app, or website either in a complex manner or in a simpler, more efficient manner. I am usually in the former group; however, I have never deemed it as a weakness. It is my strength because it means that I approach problems from a different perspective and I am creative in my own way.

This was my first group programming project where I gained so much insight into how crucial it is for team members to cooperate in order to build a successful program. As our project progressed, we faced a major challenge: we had to integrate our individual codes into one extensive program. We made numerous attempts to find the right path; if one way came to a dead end, we sought another. After days of discussing and searching, we had eventually figured out how to merge several files into one. At first, we knew we made a huge detour around an unknown, more direct solution. Yet, that detour became an incentive to discovering a more straightforward solution.

This game is a story-driven game that includes multiple levels, each having different kinds of games. For instance, the first level is the Memory game where a user needs to prove that he/she is intelligent enough to pass the first level, proceed to the next stage, and get close to obtaining the prize at the end of the game.

At the very beginning of this term, I wanted to make an app that was unique and helpful to minorities and could resolve even a small problem they were facing. I was having trouble with memorizing the American Sign Language alphabets, so I decided to build an app that works as effective ASL alphabet flashcards that implement spaced repetition, a powerful studying technique.

I learned how to link a website with a button, Swift fundamental syntax, and other basic operating systems including app icons, images, storyboards, and various sources Xcode offers. I had an idea that provides users with more diverse studying options, such as simple flashcards, tests, and matching games. To do that, I realized that it would require multiple interchangeable views for a smooth user experience. That particular skill I acquired while learning about multiple view controllers came in extremely useful when understanding the code my team and I have constructed for the EPHS App.

I wanted to make a useful app that would improve EPHS students' everyday lives, rather than a game. Then, I recalled my first day of high school being overwhelmed by a maze of school hallways. I remembered having to click so many links in order to communicate with teachers and counselors. So, as a group, we decided to create an app that is the ultimate EPHS guide, involving a virtual school map, daily schedules, club announcements, direct contact with teachers and counselors, and other diverse features. We have built a login view for security reasons so that only EPHS students are permitted to access the school map. We have several views that switch when a user clicks a button.

# [Star Wars (Scratch)](https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/190889727)

This is the game that I made using Scratch.

Press SPACE bar to shoot. Move the cursor to change the direction the character is facing. Press A, S, D, and W to move around. Press 1 and 2 to change your weapon.

# [Ping Pong (MIT App Inventor)](https://github.com/rachelPark1/ping-pong.git)

This is a two-player ping pong game I built using MIT App Inventor.

# [Website: Dog (HTML)](https://codepen.io/pen/?template=XaoZMz)

This is a website about dogs I created using HTML.

# [Website: South Dakota (HTML)](https://codepen.io/pen/?template=qPRozr)

This is a website about South Dakota I created using HTML.

# [Python](https://github.com/rachelPark1/python-files.git)

These are all the coding that I did when learning Python.
